My biggest time sink was reading all the tutorials linked to from the project page to learn d3. Taken together, the tutorials were quite repetitive and I think only Scott Murray's was necessary for this project. Going in, I was already familiar with web development, JavaScript and AJAX, so developing this visualization amounted to iterating through the steps in the specification and adapting my code around the tutorials' guidelines . Testing and debugging went very smoothly thanks to Chrome's debugger and console.

I found myself reading lots of tutorial code and calling the same methods with different targets. To simplify this, I suggest a method whereby the developer copies the codebase of a small but functional project close to what he/she wants, and modifies it incrementally until they have a unique product. Languages and libraries are becoming more intuitive with smaller learning curves, so encouraging the developer to read snippets of code and change them expedites development while also allowing them to pick up an intuition for the code.
