CS162 Group 23 Projects 3-4 Repo
================================

*"Basically everyone just fuck around with everything."*

FYI
---

In general, please don't push to the **master** branch unless it is thoroughly unit-tested, though feel free to create your own branches as you code and test.

Repo is primed for work on project 3. Please clone/fork/whatever this repo before starting. The `build.py` script and `part*.tex` templates are already in `design/proj3`. Remember to use it just run `python build.py 1 2 3 4 5` to build all five parts (or change the numbers to select certain parts) into `out.pdf`.
