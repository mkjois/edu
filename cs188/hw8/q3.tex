\begin{problem}[]{The Value of Games}

Pacman is the model of rationality and seeks to maximize his expected utility,\\
but that doesn't mean he never plays games.


\begin{question}[4] \textbf{A Costly Game.}
  Pacman is now stuck playing a new game with only costs and no payoff. Instead
  of maximizing expected utility $V(s)$, he has to minimize expected costs
  $J(s)$.  In place of a reward function, there is a cost function $C(s,a,s')$
  for transitions from $s$ to $s'$ by action $a$. We denote the discount
  factor by $\gamma \in (0,1)$. $J^*(s)$ is the expected cost incurred by the
  optimal policy. Which one of the following equations is satisfied by $J^*$?

\begin{question}[4] \textbf{It's a conspiracy again!}
  The ghosts have rigged the costly game so that once Pacman takes an action
  they can pick the outcome from all states $s' \in S'(s,a)$, the set of all
  $s'$ with non-zero probability according to $T(s,a,s')$. Choose the correct
  Bellman-style equation for Pacman against the adversarial ghosts.
