\begin{problem}[]{Minimax MDPs}
This exercise considers two-player MDPs that correspond to zero-sum minimax games. Let the players be $A$ and $B$, and let $R(s)$ be the reward for player $A$ in state $s$ (the reward for $B$ is always equal and opposite).

\begin{question}[4]
Let $U_A(s)$ be the utility of state $s$ when it is $A$'s turn to move in $s$, and let $U_B(s)$ be the utility of state $s$ when it is $B$'s turn to move in $s$. All rewards and utilities are calculated from $A$'s point of view (just as in a minimax game tree). Write down Bellman equations defining $U_A(s)$ and $U_B(s)$. \\
