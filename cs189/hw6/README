Run `python hw6.py` and observe output. Change the four parameters at the top of the file `CROSS_VALIDATION`, `TRAIN_FULL`, `PLOT_THINGS` and `TEST_SET` to run cross validation, train on the full training set, plot accuracy and loss metrics and generate Kaggle results, respectively. Plot images can be found in the `images/` directory. You can also change the `kwargs` dictionary at the top to try different things, as documented below.

FIELD[DEFAULT] : VALUES...
----------------------------
loss[mse]      : [mse, cross]
init[uniform]  : [uniform, gaussian]
epsilon[1.0]   : <float> ([-x,x] for uniform, stddev=x for gaussian)
batch[1]       : <int>
eta[0.001]     : <float>
iter[10000]    : <int>
plot[False]    : <bool>
debug[False]   : <bool>
